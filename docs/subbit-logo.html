            <p class="case-hero-intro">
            Subbit.xyz is a <strong>trustless subscription layer</strong> designed to manage decentralised, automated recurring payments without intermediaries. The visual identity was developed to reflect its role as infrastructure while remaining practical for digital use across interfaces and platforms.

        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <p>The design is based on <strong>three practical objectives</strong> aligned with Subbit’s function:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure Representation</strong>: the structured, geometric letterforms communicate <strong>stability, logic, and system reliability</strong>. Each letter box represents a distinct subscription package, reinforcing the idea that Subbit operates as a structured layer managing multiple recurring payment agreements. The design avoids decorative elements in favour of <strong>clarity and repeatable construction</strong>, supporting the perception of a protocol built for predictable, automated execution.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription Continuiy</strong>: the <strong>sequential nature</strong> of the letters reflects ongoing, automated payment cycles</strong>. While each character is usable on its own, their combined form represents the continuous operation of the subscription layer.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform Compatibility</strong>: the rounded square containers support <strong>consistent display</strong> across product surfaces such as dashboards, app icons, interface components, and protocol visual markers.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

<!-- RESULT -->

        <div class="container">
            <h3>Result</h3>

        <div class="result-text">
            <ul>A clear, <strong>system-oriented visual identity</strong> that reflects Subbit.xyz’s role as a trustless subscription layer. The logo supports <strong>flexible deployment</strong> across digital products while maintaining consistency, legibility, and alignment with the platform’s technical purpose.</ul>

            <ul>The final design positions Subbit as a reliable protocol identity, focused on function, continuity, and usability within decentralised payment environments.</ul>
