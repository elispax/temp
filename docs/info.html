    UX/UI and brand designer
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm Elisa, a <strong>visual and UX/UI designer</strong> based in Paris. I help teams turn complex ideas into clear, intuitive digital products. With ten years of visual experience, including in-house fashion photography and graphic design, I bring a <strong>versatile eye for detail</strong> and a grounded, <strong>problem-solving approach</strong> to every project.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve designed mobile apps and Web3 products such as Konduit.Channel, working closely with teams to define <strong>user journeys</strong>, refine <strong>product flows</strong>, and build interfaces that feel <strong>simple, cohesive, and purposeful</strong>. My approach blends <strong>visual clarity</strong> with thoughtful <strong>UX strategy</strong> — always grounded in experimentation and real user needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clients choose to work with me for my <strong>adaptability, curiosity, and ability</strong> to move from concept to polished design quickly and collaboratively. Whether you're building something new or improving an existing experience, I create meaningful, <strong>user-centered solutions</strong> that support your product’s goals.
