<!-- Overview + Key Considerations -->

    <div id="challenge">
      <h3>Overview:</h3>
      <p>
        Rachel’s previous website <strong>lacked visual hierarchy and organization</strong>, making it difficult for visitors—such as editors, collaborators, and readers—to quickly understand her areas of expertise or explore her recent publications. My goal was to <strong>simplify the experience, improve content discoverability, and create a polished, visually simple  design</strong> that supports her personal brand and is easy to maintain.
      </p>
    </div>


    <div class="key-considerations">
      <h3>Key considerations:</h3>
      <p>The original design presented several <strong>UX issues</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unclear navigation</strong> made it difficult for users to understand the scope of her work.</li>
        <li><strong>Inconsistent use of color and layout</strong> resulted in a visual experience that felt unintentionally playful rather than professional.</li>
        <li><strong>No obvious contact path</strong>, which could limit opportunities for potential clients or editors wanting to get in touch.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="approach">
        <h3>Improvements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The landing page now highlights recent articles, <strong>improving content discoverability</strong> and <strong>reducing user friction</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Reorganized content</strong> into “Print” and “Online” categories, giving users a <strong>clear mental model</strong> of the writer’s portfolio and <strong>improving navigation</strong>.</li>
          <li>Introduced a <strong>minimal, grid-based layout</strong> to convey professionalism, <strong>reduce cognitive load</strong>, and ensure timeless visual appeal.</li>
          <li>Contacts added on the page footer to make contacting the writer <strong>seamless</strong>.</li>

      While this was a self-initiated concept project, the redesign demonstrates clear UX and business value:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Improved readability and hierarchy</strong>, allowing visitors to find relevant articles faster</li>
      <li>More <strong>polished personal brand</strong>, aligned with Rachel’s writing tone</li>
      <li>Streamlined content architecture, <strong>reducing user friction</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Clearer messaging</strong>, helping editors understand her strengths at a glance</li>
